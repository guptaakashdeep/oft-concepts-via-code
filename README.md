# oft-concepts-via-code
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for understanding/learning different concepts of Open Format Tables like Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi and Delta Lake Tables using Apache Spark.

## How to navigate this repository
Main level folders are the OFT table names that include 2 folders mainly:
- `aws`: Include the notebooks that can be used to run and learn the OFT concepts on AWS.
- `local`: Include the notebooks that can be used to run and learn the OFT concepts on local workstation.

All the notebooks present in this repo have a respective blog post on my website: https://guptaakashdeep.com where I have explained all these OFT concepts in detail along with the code.
